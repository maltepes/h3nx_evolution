Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule filter in file /nextstrain/build/Snakefile, line 122:
Job 5  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/filtered/filtered_h3nx_ha.txt
Removing output files of failed job filter since they might be corrupted:
results/filtered/filtered_h3nx_ha.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
