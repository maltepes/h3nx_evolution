Job 5: 
        Filtering to
          - 30 sequence(s) per year country host subtype
          - excluding strains in config/dropped_strains_h3nx.txt
          - samples with missing region and country metadata
          - excluding strains prior to 1960
        
Reason: Missing output files: results/filtered/filtered_h3nx_ha.fasta, results/filtered/filtered_h3nx_ha.txt

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule filter in file /nextstrain/build/Snakefile, line 122:
Job 5  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/filtered/filtered_h3nx_ha.txt
Removing output files of failed job filter since they might be corrupted:
results/filtered/filtered_h3nx_ha.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
